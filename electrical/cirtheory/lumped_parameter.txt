A circuit is being designed to operate at 23 GHz. 1 GHz is 109 Hz. Assume the circuit elements are 0.7 cm in size on average and that the speed of light is 3 x 108 m/s. The lumped-parameter approximation states that circuit elements should be less than 1/10 of the wavelength in order for basic circuit theory to correctly model the underlying physics. What is the difference between the average circuit element size and 1/10 of the wavelength (in cm)? Calculate 1/10 of the wavelength minus the average circuit size. Specify your answer to two decimal places. The word difference usually means a positive quantity. In this question it can be a negative number. I'll fix this for next year.
